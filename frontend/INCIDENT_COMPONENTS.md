/>
```

## Navigation

The new incident dashboard can be accessed at `/incidents-dashboard` in the application. The navigation has been updated to include this new route.

## Next Steps

To further enhance the incident management system, consider:

1. WebSocket integration for real-time updates
2. Integration with actual backend APIs
3. Export functionality for incident reports
4. Bulk actions for multiple incidents
5. Advanced analytics and reporting
6. Integration with notification systems
7. Incident templates for common issues
8. Post-mortem report generation
