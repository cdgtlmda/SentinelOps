# SentinelOps Failover Mechanisms Guide

## Overview
This guide describes the failover mechanisms implemented in SentinelOps to ensure continuous availability during regional outages.

## Failover Architecture

### Components
1. **Health Check System**: Monitors service health across all regions
2. **Failover Controller**: Automated decision-making for failover events
3. **Traffic Management**: Dynamic routing based on health status
4. **Data Synchronization**: Ensures data consistency across regions

### Region Hierarchy
- **Primary**: us-central1 (Default: 70% traffic)
- **Secondary**: us-east1 (Default: 20% traffic)
- **Tertiary**: us-west1 (Default: 10% traffic)

## Failover Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
1. **Complete Region Failure**: All services in a region are unhealthy
2. **Partial Region Failure**: >50% of services are unhealthy for >5 minutes
3. **Performance Degradation**: Response time >2x baseline for >10 minutes
4. **Capacity Exhaustion**: Region at >90% capacity for >15 minutes

### Manual Triggers
- Planned maintenance
- Disaster recovery drills
- Regional compliance requirements

## Failover Process

### Phase 1: Detection (0-30 seconds)
1. Health checks detect service failures
2. Failover controller validates failure pattern
3. Pre-failover checks initiated

### Phase 2: Decision (30-60 seconds)
1. Evaluate available regions
2. Select target region based on:
   - Health status
   - Current capacity
   - Geographic proximity
   - Data synchronization status

### Phase 3: Execution (60-120 seconds)
1. Update traffic routing rules
2. Modify health check priorities
3. Sync critical data
4. Update DNS records (if applicable)
5. Send notifications

### Phase 4: Validation (120-180 seconds)
1. Verify traffic flow to new region
2. Confirm service health
3. Monitor error rates
4. Log failover event

## Traffic Routing Strategies

### Normal Operation
```
Primary Region:   70% of traffic
Secondary Region: 20% of traffic
Tertiary Region:  10% of traffic
```

### Primary Failure
```
Primary Region:   0% of traffic
Secondary Region: 70% of traffic
Tertiary Region:  30% of traffic
```

### Cascade Failure
```
All healthy regions share traffic equally
```

## Failover Commands

### Monitor Health Status
```bash
python scripts/failover_controller.py
```

### Manual Failover
```bash
# Failover from primary to secondary
python scripts/failover_automation.py us-central1 us-east1

# Rollback last failover
python scripts/failover_automation.py rollback
```

### Update Traffic Routing
```bash
# Set to failover mode
./scripts/configure_traffic_routing.sh failover-primary

# Return to normal
./scripts/configure_traffic_routing.sh default
```

### Test Failover
```bash
# Test primary region failure
./scripts/test_failover_scenarios.sh test-primary-failure

# Test cascade failure
./scripts/test_failover_scenarios.sh test-cascade-failure
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics
1. **Region Health Score**: Percentage of healthy services
2. **Failover Frequency**: Number of failovers per day/week
3. **Recovery Time**: Time from detection to recovery
4. **Data Lag**: Replication delay between regions

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Any region completely down
- **Warning**: Region health <80%
- **Info**: Failover executed successfully

## Testing Schedule

### Daily
- Automated health check validation
- Traffic routing verification

### Weekly
- Single service failure simulation
- Failover controller test

### Monthly
- Full region failure drill
- Cascade failure scenario
- Rollback procedures

### Quarterly
- Complete disaster recovery exercise
- Multi-region failure simulation
- Performance benchmarking

## Troubleshooting

### Failover Not Triggering
1. Check health check configuration
2. Verify failover controller is running
3. Review threshold settings
4. Check network connectivity

### Failover Loop
1. Verify both regions are truly healthy
2. Check for configuration drift
3. Review recent changes
4. Increase failover cooldown period

### Slow Failover
1. Check pre-failover validation time
2. Review traffic routing update speed
3. Optimize data sync processes
4. Verify DNS TTL settings

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Test failover monthly
2. **Monitor Metrics**: Track failover frequency and duration
3. **Document Changes**: Log all configuration modifications
4. **Review Logs**: Analyze failover events for improvements
5. **Update Runbooks**: Keep procedures current

## Recovery Procedures

### After Automatic Failover
1. Investigate root cause in failed region
2. Resolve issues
3. Test services in failed region
4. Plan failback during low-traffic period
5. Execute controlled failback

### After Manual Failover
1. Complete planned maintenance
2. Verify service health
3. Gradual traffic restoration
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Document lessons learned
