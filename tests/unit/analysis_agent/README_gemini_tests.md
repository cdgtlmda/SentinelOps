# Gemini Integration Test Implementation Summary

## Implemented Test Files

### 1. test_gemini_known_incidents.py
Tests the integration's ability to analyze and respond to known security incident patterns:
- Unauthorized access pattern testing
- Data exfiltration pattern testing  
- Privilege escalation pattern testing
- Malware infection pattern testing
- Utilizes GeminiResponseFixtures for realistic test scenarios

### 2. test_gemini_edge_cases.py
Tests handling of unusual, malformed, or edge case scenarios:
- Malformed response handling
- Empty sections response handling
- Special characters and injection attempts in responses
- Extremely long responses
- Unicode and emoji handling
- Null/None value handling
- Invalid confidence scores
- Concurrent request edge cases
- Response timeout handling
- Partial/incomplete response handling
- Nested JSON structure handling

### 3. test_gemini_adversarial.py
Tests robustness against malicious or adversarial inputs:
- Prompt injection attack protection
- Malicious log content handling
- Resource exhaustion attempt protection
- Output manipulation attempt handling
- Model confusion attack resistance
- Data poisoning attempt handling
- Hallucination inducement resistance
- Safety filter bypass attempts
- Timing attack resistance

### 4. test_gemini_performance.py  
Performance benchmark tests to ensure integration meets requirements:
- Single request latency benchmarking (P95, P99)
- Concurrent request handling performance
- Batch processing throughput testing
- Token processing rate benchmarking
- Memory efficiency under load
- Rate limit handling performance
- Model profile switching overhead

### 5. test_gemini_latency.py
Detailed latency testing for response time analysis:
- Response time distribution across scenarios
- Streaming response latency (time to first token)
- Cold start vs warm request latency
- Request size impact on latency
- Timeout behavior and recovery
- Latency degradation under concurrent load
- Retry mechanism latency impact

## Test Coverage

All test scenarios from the checklist have been implemented:
- ✓ Known incident patterns - Complete coverage of common security incidents
- ✓ Edge cases - Comprehensive edge case handling including malformed data
- ✓ Adversarial inputs - Security-focused testing against malicious inputs
- ✓ Performance benchmarks - Full performance metric validation
- ✓ Latency testing - Detailed latency characteristic analysis

## Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

The new tests properly integrate with:
- Existing mock setup (`common_mock_setup.py`)
- Test fixtures (`gemini_responses.py`) - Now fully utilized
- Mock Gemini client (`mocks/gemini.py`)
- pytest configuration and markers

## Verification Status

- All test files created successfully
- Tests follow existing patterns and conventions
- Mock infrastructure properly utilized
- Fixtures are now being actively used
- Performance metrics defined and tested
